Now that we've looked at the architecture
of the internet, let's see how you might

2
00:00:04,131 --> 00:00:07,535
connect your personal devices to
the internet inside your house.

3
00:00:07,536 --> 00:00:11,270
Well there are many ways to
connect to the internet, and

4
00:00:11,271 --> 00:00:13,960
most often people connect wirelessly.

5
00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:17,940
Let's look at an example of how
you can connect to the internet.

6
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:22,370
If you live in a city or a town,
you probably have a coaxial cable for

7
00:00:22,371 --> 00:00:26,880
cable Internet, or a phone line if you
have DSL, running to the outside of

8
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:30,920
your house, that connects you to
the Internet Service Provider, or ISP.

9
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:34,730
If you live far out in the country,
you'll more likely have

10
00:00:34,731 --> 00:00:39,430
a dish outside your house, connecting
you wirelessly to your closest ISP, or

11
00:00:39,431 --> 00:00:41,190
you might also use the telephone system.

12
00:00:42,351 --> 00:00:46,300
Whether a wire comes straight from
the ISP hookup outside your house, or

13
00:00:46,301 --> 00:00:49,270
it travels over radio
waves from your roof,

14
00:00:49,271 --> 00:00:53,760
the first stop a wire will make once
inside your house, is at your modem.

15
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:57,780
A modem is what connects the internet
to your network at home.

16
00:00:57,781 --> 00:01:00,150
A few common residential modems are DSL or
